CardGames is a small, personal project that makes use of Java to replicate as accurately as possible the rules and gameplay of common card games,
with the additional support of allowing a user to import and use decks of their own design as .txt files. Currently blackjack is functional in its
entirety, with the betting aspect of the game absent, but future games are planned, along with better UI support.
